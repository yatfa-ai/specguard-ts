#
# Ported from specguard-mcp's script/bump-version.sh — same strategy, same
# guards — with one adaptation: this package is SCOPED (`@yatfa/specguard`),
# so the already-published probe asks the registry for a scoped path. npm's
# registry serves `/@scope/name/version` unencoded (the `%2F` form answers
# identically), so no escaping is needed here.
#
# Strategy carried over verbatim: must be on main with a clean tree, patch-only
# bump, commit "bump: X -> Y", pull --rebase + push with up to 3 retries.
#
# When run inside GitHub Actions (GITHUB_OUTPUT set), exports `version` and
# `tag` to the step's job outputs. Locally it just prints the new version.

# published npm version is immutable, so that divergence would be permanent.

# `-f` makes a retry idempotent when an earlier attempt created the local tag but
# failed to push it. It cannot clobber a published tag: the tag-reuse guard above
# already refused that case before any work started.
